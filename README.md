# What is BrainGenix-STS?

BrainGenix-STS is the Scan Translation System division of the BrainGenix Department. The main goal of STS is the functional translation of architectural data from scans of brain tissue and the to-be-developed generic working model of the human brain. Depending on feasibility, additional functional data may be incorporated as required. STS will incorporate the functional and structural data it recieves into a workable model to be run on the other divisions of the BrainGenix software suite, namely NES and ERS.

## Key Features

 - Like the other BrainGenix divisions, STS will utilize Apache Zookeeper for coordination and Apache Kafka for navigation of the inter-node aspect of our distributed system.
 - Management of the entire BrainGenix software suite can be acomplished via BrainGenix's unified CLI or GUI.
 - STS interfaces directly with NES and ERS, the other parts of BrainGenix.
