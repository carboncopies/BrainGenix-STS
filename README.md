# What is BrainGenix-STS?

BrainGenix Scan Translation System (STS) aims to facilitate the functional translation of architectural data from scans of brain tissue and the to-be-developed generic working model of the human brain. Depending on feasibility, additional functional data may be incorporated as required. STS will incorporate the functional and structural data it receives into a workable model to be run on the other divisions of the BrainGenix software suite, namely NES and ERS.

## Key Features

 - Like the other BrainGenix divisions, STS will utilize Apache Zookeeper for coordination and Apache Kafka for navigation of the inter-node aspect of our distributed system.
 - Management of the entire BrainGenix software suite can be acomplished via BrainGenix's unified CLI or GUI.
 - STS interfaces directly with NES and ERS, the other parts of BrainGenix.
